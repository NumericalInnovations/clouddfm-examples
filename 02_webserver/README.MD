# Cloud DFM Web Server Example
This is a NodeJS example web server that hides your CLOUDDFM_TOKEN behind your server
and makes calls to our API.

## Installation
* Type `npm i` to install Node modules
* Open `app.js` and replace CLOUDDFM_TOKEN with your own token.
* Type `node app.js` to start web server.
* Open a browser and point to `http://localhost:3000`
* Pick Gerber files and make sure there is an FM6 file included also.
* Submit, it will process, and pictures will display.
