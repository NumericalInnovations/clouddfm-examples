# Cloud DFM Basic DFM Checker Example
This is a very basic example that results in a TXT and PDF file.  
Your `CLOUDDFM_TOKEN` should never be exposed to the public.  
This is only to show how our API can be used.  Please see "Cloud DFM Web Server Example"
for a better example of CloudDFM usage on your own web server.

## Installation
* Open `index.html` in an editor and replace CLOUDDFM_TOKEN with your own token.
* Open a browser and point to the `index.html` local file.
* Pick Gerber files and choose a layer type from the drop down.
* Press the submit button, wait for processing, and 2 links will display.
